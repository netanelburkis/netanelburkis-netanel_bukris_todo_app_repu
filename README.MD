## **CI/CD Pipeline**⚙️
## 🛠️ CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This project uses a **Jenkins pipeline** (defined in the `Jenkinsfile`) to fully automate the build, test, and deployment process using Jenkins.

---

### 🔄 Pipeline Stages

#### 1. 🧰 Install Dependencies
Installs Python packages and Selenium WebDriver dependencies.

#### 2. 🧪 Run Unit Tests
Executes unit tests using **Pytest** to validate core functionality.

#### 3. 🎯 Run End-to-End (E2E) Tests
Uses **Selenium** to simulate user interactions and verify the app’s behavior in a browser environment.

#### 4. 🐳 Build Docker Image
Creates a Docker image using the `Dockerfile`, tagged with the build number and Git commit hash.

#### 5. 📤 Push Docker Image to Registry
Pushes the image to **DockerHub** (or your private registry) for versioned deployment.

#### 6. 🚧 Deploy to Staging Environment 
- Used for validation, manual testing, and QA checks

#### 7. ⏸️ Manual Approval Step (Optional)
- Pauses the pipeline before deploying to production  
- Allows team members to verify staging results

#### 8. 🚀 Deploy to Production 
- **Nginx** handles reverse proxy to serve the app to users  
- Static content served securely and efficiently

#### 9. ✅ Post-Deployment Health Check
- Sends HTTP request(s) to validate application is running (e.g., `curl /health`)  
- Notifies via **Slack** or **email** on success/failure (optional)

### 📂 CI/CD Configuration

All CI/CD-related files are located in a dedicated **configuration repository** for better separation of concerns and reusability across projects.

🔗 [CI/CD Configuration Repository](https://github.com/netanelburkis/todo_list-cd.git)

🔗 CI/CD Configuration Repository
Included in the CI/CD Configuration Repository:

Jenkinsfile (Pipeline as Code)

Application Setup (Nginx, MySQL, Flask)

Versioning and Tag Management

Deployment and Rollback Scripts

🤖 How Ansible & Terraform Fit into the CI/CD Pipeline
Ansible and Terraform work together to automate infrastructure management and ensure that the application is deployed on consistent, reproducible environments.

🚀 Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Terraform is used to provision and manage the infrastructure that the ToDo List application runs on. With Terraform, we define the infrastructure resources (like EC2 instances, RDS databases, VPCs, etc.) in code, which allows for:

Reproducibility: The infrastructure setup can be re-applied on multiple environments (staging, production, etc.) and can be easily versioned.

Scalability: Infrastructure resources can be created, modified, and destroyed automatically as needed.

🚧 How Terraform Works in the Pipeline
Provisioning the Infrastructure:

Terraform is used in the pipeline to automatically provision resources like EC2 instances, load balancers, RDS databases, etc.

The pipeline will trigger terraform apply to provision resources in the required environments (staging and production).
Example command:
```bash
terraform init  # Initializes the Terraform working directory
terraform apply -var-file=staging.tfvars  # Applies the configuration for staging
```
Infrastructure Updates:
Whenever there is a change in the infrastructure requirements (e.g., scaling up EC2 instances or adding more databases), Terraform handles those updates automatically.

Environment Consistency:
Terraform ensures that all environments are consistent. Whether you're deploying to staging or production, the same infrastructure configuration will be applied, ensuring no environment drift.

🤖 Ansible: Configuration Management
Once the infrastructure is provisioned by Terraform, Ansible takes over to configure the servers and deploy the application. Ansible is used to:

Install and configure Nginx, MySQL, and Flask on the provisioned infrastructure.

Deploy the latest Docker images to the staging and production environments.

🚧 Full Pipeline Flow with Terraform, Ansible, and Jenkins:
Terraform provisions the infrastructure:

EC2 instances, databases, networking, etc.

Ansible automates the configuration of the infrastructure:

Install and configure the necessary software (Nginx, MySQL, Flask).

Deploy the Docker container to the infrastructure.

Jenkins manages the CI/CD pipeline:

Build and test the application.

Trigger Terraform and Ansible as part of the deployment process.

✅ Benefits of This Setup
🔁 Repeatable & Reliable: Consistent builds and deployments with every push to the repository, with infrastructure managed as code.

🧪 Test-Driven: Ensures code quality through automated unit tests and end-to-end tests.

📦 Containerized: Fast, isolated deployments using Docker, simplifying the management of dependencies and application environment.

🚀 Multi-Environment Deployments: Clear separation between staging and production environments.

🔐 Secure by Design: Secrets are managed securely, with isolated build and deployment environments.

📈 Scalable Infrastructure: Terraform allows for automated, scalable infrastructure provisioning.

🌍 Cloud-Native: Full automation with cloud resources (e.g., EC2, RDS, VPC) managed via Terraform.

📥 Notifications (Jenkins)
Jenkins can notify you upon successful or failed pipeline stages using Slack or Email integrations.

Make sure to configure the appropriate Slack webhook or Email notification in Jenkins.

## *Installation* 🔧

*Clone the repository*:   
```bash   
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-by-netanel-bukris.git  
cd todo-list-by-netanel-bukris
```

**Create a `requirements.txt`**:  
This file contains all the dependencies for the project. If it is not already created, you can generate it by running:
```bash   
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

1. Set up the MySQL database:
Ensure you have a MySQL database running locally or use Docker to set up a MySQL container. Here are the details to configure in your app_project.py:
```python 
DB_HOST = os.environ.get("DB_HOST", "db")  # Default to 'db' if running in Docker
DB_USER = os.environ.get("DB_USER", "python_todo_list_app")
DB_PASSWORD = os.environ.get("DB_PASSWORD", "123password")
DB_NAME = os.environ.get("DB_NAME", "todo_list_app_db")
```

Note: You can change the database connection settings by modifying the environment variables instead of using the default values. These variables can be set in multiple places:

~1 Using environment variables directly in your system:
```python 
export DB_HOST=your_custom_host
export DB_USER=your_custom_user
export DB_PASSWORD=your_custom_password
export DB_NAME=your_custom_db
```
~2 Note on Customizing Environment Variables in Docker Compose:

You can easily modify environment variables to customize your app's configuration. These values are defined within the docker-compose.yaml file in the app service section under environment. By editing these variables, you can control the database connection settings, such as DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, and DB_NAME.
For example: 
```yaml 
services:  
  app:  
    build: .  
    environment:  
      - FLASK_APP=app_project.py  
      - FLASK_ENV=production  
      - DB_HOST=db  # You can change this value to your custom database host
      - DB_USER=python_todo_list_app  # Change as needed
      - DB_PASSWORD=123password  # Change as needed
      - DB_NAME=todo_list_app_db  # Change as needed 
    depends_on:  
      - db  
```
**Don't forget to also update the environment variables of the db accordingly:**
```yaml 
  db:  
    image: mysql:8.0 
    environment:  
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword # Change as needed  
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=todo_list_app_db # Change as needed 
      - MYSQL_USER=python_todo_list_app # Change as needed 
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=123password # Change as needed 
```
or with:
```python 
export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD= your_custom_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
export MYSQL_USER=your_custom_user
export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_custom_password
export MYSQL_DATABASE=your_custom_db
```

This flexibility allows you to run the same code on different environments (e.g., local, staging, production) without changing the code itself.

2. Install dependencies:
Using pip to install the requirements:
```bash   
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Flask application:
You can run the application using the command:
```bash
flask run
```

Or if you want to run it in debug mode:
```bash   
flask run --debugger
```

4. ### **Docker Setup (optional):**

If you'd like to use Docker for setting up the application, use the provided Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml to build and run the app.

Build the Docker image:
```bash 
docker-compose build
```

Start the application:
```bash 
docker-compose up
```

## **Docker Compose Setup**

The project includes a docker-compose.yaml file to set up all the services:
```yaml 
services:
  app_1:
    image: netanelbukris/to_do_list
    environment:
      FLASK_APP: app_project.py
      FLASK_ENV: production
      DB_HOST: db
      DB_USER: python_todo_list_app
      DB_PASSWORD: 123password
      DB_NAME: todo_list_app_db
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
    - front
    - back

  app_2:
    image: netanelbukris/to_do_list
    environment:
      FLASK_APP: app_project.py
      FLASK_ENV: production
      DB_HOST: db
      DB_USER: python_todo_list_app
      DB_PASSWORD: 123password
      DB_NAME: todo_list_app_db
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
    - front
    - back

  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: todo_list_app_db
      MYSQL_USER: python_todo_list_app
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: 123password
    volumes:
    -  sql_data:/var/lib/mysql
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
      interval: 10s
      retries: 5
      timeout: 5s
    networks:
    - back

  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    -  "80:80"
    volumes:
    -  ./nginx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template
    depends_on:
    -  app_1
    -  app_2
    environment:
      APP_1_HOST: app_1
      APP_2_HOST: app_2
    networks:
    - front

volumes:
  sql_data:

networks:
  back:
  front:
 ```

## **Dockerfile Overview**
```bash 
# Create and set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container  
COPY requirements.txt /app/

# Install the dependencies from the requirements file  
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the entire application code into the container  
COPY . /app/

# Expose the Flask app's default port  
EXPOSE 5000

# Define the command to run the app using Gunicorn   
CMD ["gunicorn", "--workers", "4", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app_project:todo_list_app"]
  ```

You can use the dockerfile or the image from docker: 
netanelbukris/to_do_list

## **Nginx Configuration**

To arrange the configuration we will create a folder called nginx in the root of the project and inside it we will create a file called default.conf:

 ```nginx  
# nginx/nginx.conf
upstream flask_backend {
	server ${APP_1_HOST}:5000;
	server ${APP_2_HOST}:5000;
    }

    server {
	listen 80;

	location / {
	    proxy_pass http://flask_backend;
	    proxy_set_header Host $host;
	    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
	}
     }

 ```
We'll make sure we've created a volume for nginx in our Docker Compos like this:
```yaml 
  nginx:  
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    -  "80:80"  
    volumes:  
    -  ./nginx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template   
```
 **Nginx Configuration File (default.conf)**
The default.conf file, located in the nginx/ directory, contains:

Upstream - Defining the Backend
upstream flask_backend defines a group of servers that Nginx will forward requests to.
${APP_1_HOST}:5000, {APP_2_HOST}:5000 is the address of our applications (Flask runs on port 5000).

**APP_1\2_HOST is an environment variable that is defined in docker-compose.yaml .**
**Note that it is set correctly**
```yaml 
 nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    -  "80:80"
    volumes:
    -  ./nginx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template
    depends_on:
    -  app_1
    -  app_2
    environment:
      APP_1_HOST: app_1
      APP_2_HOST: app_2
```
Server Configuration (server)
listen 80; instructs Nginx to listen for incoming requests on port 80.
location / {} defines that all requests reaching / will be forwarded to flask_backend using proxy_pass http://flask_backend.
proxy_set_header is used to pass information such as:
Host - the original hostname of the request.
X-Real-IP - the real IP address of the client.
X-Forwarded-For - the IP addresses of the proxies the request has passed through..

We will create two back and front networks to separate our application nginx and database:
```yaml 
networks:
  back:
  front:
```
When the apps are connected to both the back and the front, the database will be connected to the back and nginx to the front.

## **testing**🧪
The project uses Selenium for automating browser tests and Pytest for running the tests.

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1.Install the required dependencies for testing:

```bash 
pip install -r app/test/requirements.txt
  ```

2.Run the Selenium-based tests with Pytest:

```bash
pytest app/test/test_selenium_in_parts.py
  ```
This will execute the tests and verify the app's functionality.

## **coverage**

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, including **coverage**, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install coverage
  ```
## **Usage with Pytest**
1.Running Tests with Coverage:
You can use coverage to run your tests with pytest by running the following command:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
  ```
This will run all your tests and record which lines of code were covered during the test execution.

2.Running Selenium Tests:
If you're running Selenium-specific tests, you can specify your test file (for example, selenium.py) at the end:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest selenium.py
  ```
## **Viewing Coverage Report**
After running your tests with coverage, you can view a detailed report of the coverage:

1.Text Report:
To display the coverage report directly in the terminal, use:

```bash
coverage report
  ```
2.HTML Report:
You can generate an HTML version of the coverage report, which will allow you to see which lines were covered with color coding (green for covered, red for not covered):

```bash
coverage html
  ```
3.Opening HTML Report:
Once the HTML report is generated, you can view it by opening the index.html file in a web browser:

```bash
open htmlcov/index.html
  ```
This will give you a visual representation of your test coverage.
